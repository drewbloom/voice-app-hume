        "case_synopsis": "Frank Lee Aiken is a 75-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with three days of worsening intermittent abdominal pain. His pain is accompanied by nausea and anorexia, but no vomiting. He has gone four days without a bowel movement. Over the last five months, he has unintentionally lost 15 pounds and experienced low-grade fatigue. Past history is remarkable for hypertension and Gold Stage II COPD and no previous surgeries. He is independent in ADLs but his son manages all his IADLs, and he walks slowly with a rolling walker for limited distances. His physical exam reveals diffuse tenderness without peritoneal signs. Further workup shows microcytic anemia, mild hyponatremia, and mildly increased creatinine. A CT scan shows an obstructing, left-sided colonic mass, enlarged regional lymph nodes, and nodules in the liver and left lung. He is taken to the operating room; the mass is resected and a loop colostomy is created. Postoperatively, he develops delirium due to acute urinary retention. After discharge, he is tried on two chemotherapy regimens but does not tolerate either. He ultimately opts for hospice at home and passes comfortably.",
